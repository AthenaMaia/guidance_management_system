# Dashboard 500 Error - FIXED! ðŸŽ‰

## Issue Summary
The dashboard was returning a 500 Internal Server Error with the message: `Unable to locate file in Vite manifest: resources/css/sidebar.css`

## Root Cause
The Laravel app layout was trying to load `resources/css/sidebar.css` using the `@vite()` directive, but this file wasn't included in the Vite build configuration. This caused a Vite manifest error during runtime.

## Solution Applied
Updated the `vite.config.js` file to include the missing CSS file in the build process:

**Before:**
```javascript
input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
```

**After:**
```javascript
input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/css/sidebar.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
```

## Build Results
The updated build successfully generated:
- `public/build/assets/sidebar-CEZ2LRR-.css` (0.75 kB)
- `public/build/assets/app-D9jm1eI0.css` (58.72 kB)
- `public/build/assets/app-Bf4POITK.js` (79.80 kB)

## Status Verification
âœ… **Dashboard is now working correctly!**

From the Railway logs:
- Dashboard returns `200 OK` status
- All CSS files load successfully
- Users can access dashboard after login
- Navigation to other sections (semester, etc.) working

## URL Access
The application is fully functional at:
**https://guidancemanagementsystem-production.up.railway.app**

## Login Credentials
- **Admin**: `admin123@gmail.com` / `admin123`

## Technical Details
